00:04.010 --> 00:08.900
Work come back in this video we are going to have a look at sounds and how we can use them within our

00:08.900 --> 00:09.550
games.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.920
So you can simply google for royalty free game sounds.

00:12.950 --> 00:20.480
And there you can find some websites which have multiple sounds 1000 free sound effects music tracks

00:20.480 --> 00:22.610
loops for games and so forth.

00:22.610 --> 00:29.780
As you can see you can find very many websites which have this sort of free sound sound Bible audio

00:29.780 --> 00:30.490
and music.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.770
Unity as its store.

00:31.820 --> 00:38.900
So there is one called free game music which is great and which we are going to use so well that's one

00:38.900 --> 00:43.420
option of course you can go to pay just like free sound for example.

00:43.460 --> 00:49.180
They are by Caston Flash who has created quite some music so space sound.

00:49.220 --> 00:57.010
A San Antonio Earthman which means sun tunnel open mysterious sounds and so forth.

00:57.220 --> 01:02.520
So if you want to have a bean within your game you can simply download this being here.

01:02.780 --> 01:07.160
But on this page you will have to log in to download the sound.

01:07.420 --> 01:11.190
But that's how the beam would sound for example.

01:11.420 --> 01:16.100
Well you can google and find great sounds online quite easily.

01:16.100 --> 01:19.770
But be careful that their license is Creative Commons zero.

01:19.940 --> 01:25.240
So it means that you may use them for free without having to pay any royalty fees and so on.

01:25.250 --> 01:25.550
All right.

01:25.550 --> 01:32.340
So let's go to unity let's search for absolutely free music.

01:32.480 --> 01:33.420
All right so let's go ahead.

01:33.440 --> 01:37.280
Absolutely.

01:37.280 --> 01:43.840
Free music and you'll find this as sent here by Virtex studio.

01:44.150 --> 01:49.580
And you can download that so you can download the whole package and only import just the music that

01:49.580 --> 01:50.820
you want to use.

01:51.260 --> 01:58.380
As I have already downloaded it I can import it directly and I'm just going to use any of the sounds.

01:58.550 --> 02:04.970
It's decompressing it and I don't want to use all of them but let's just use number one.

02:05.210 --> 02:07.020
That's important.

02:08.270 --> 02:14.650
And in this case I'm actually going to get rid of my canvas and my game manager.

02:14.870 --> 02:15.950
So let's delete those.

02:15.950 --> 02:17.920
No I only have my cue.

02:18.590 --> 02:20.910
Let's go back to our scene as you see.

02:20.980 --> 02:27.110
There is a new folder here called Game music and it has one sound here which is an audio file which

02:27.110 --> 02:29.050
you can now use in your game.

02:29.060 --> 02:31.090
So let's go to our cube.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.870
That's where it is.

02:33.170 --> 02:39.410
And what I want to do is I want to add a sound onto my cube itself.

02:39.590 --> 02:44.960
So let's add a component and an audio component to be precise.

02:44.990 --> 02:47.490
And then hear audio source.

02:48.130 --> 02:54.510
Let's add an audio source as you can see the audience audio source now expects an audio clip and that

02:54.520 --> 02:55.010
here.

02:55.030 --> 02:57.950
That little piece of music is an audio clip.

02:57.950 --> 03:03.460
So what you can do now is direct that audio clip into your audio source.

03:04.010 --> 03:09.130
And now it's reduced the volume because that would be a bit too loud.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.660
All right let's get started.

03:10.700 --> 03:18.860
Let's play the music or play the game and you might hear that there are some sounds coming and you can

03:18.860 --> 03:23.790
change the pitch here you can change the volume the priority any time.

03:24.830 --> 03:29.570
And the music only starts playing because now here it says play on away.

03:29.720 --> 03:38.140
So as soon as the object that contains this audio source is a awoken we will hear the music.

03:38.270 --> 03:44.360
So I'm just going to change the volume to zero then another important piece is this loop loop will allow

03:44.360 --> 03:47.780
us to run the sound over and over again.

03:47.780 --> 03:55.060
So as soon as the sound or the music is done it will start off from the beginning.

03:55.070 --> 04:00.950
Now of course there are multiple other properties here as you can see and you can access those later

04:00.950 --> 04:03.620
on via code.

04:03.830 --> 04:08.310
Now let's have a quick look how we can start to sound via code.

04:08.480 --> 04:16.320
So let's add a component in your script and I'm going to call that sound behavior.

04:17.900 --> 04:20.830
And I add that to our cube I'm going to keep it simple.

04:21.080 --> 04:28.490
So let's open up that sound behavior script and then hear what I want to do is I want to start to sound

04:28.580 --> 04:30.630
as soon as I press a button.

04:30.830 --> 04:35.270
So actually I need the update method and the update method is going to work like that.

04:35.270 --> 04:44.750
I'm going to say if there is input so if the player presses a button get key down and the key code will

04:44.750 --> 04:48.170
be let's say space.

04:49.130 --> 04:52.780
So if the player presses space go ahead and start.

04:52.820 --> 04:53.360
Sound.

04:53.390 --> 05:01.100
So to start sound and how do I get the sound what I need to get an audio source here.

05:01.220 --> 05:05.850
So public audio source

05:10.260 --> 05:13.510
and I'm just going to call that music now.

05:13.810 --> 05:19.410
Now I can go ahead in my update method and I can start to music

05:22.200 --> 05:23.490
with play.

05:23.730 --> 05:25.430
So I simply called the plaintiff.

05:25.710 --> 05:33.450
Now of course if I do that I need to be sure that music exists so that there is some music I can check

05:33.450 --> 05:35.150
here if music exists.

05:35.310 --> 05:40.180
So if it's not empty only then play the music.

05:40.230 --> 05:42.240
What that does is it checks.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.770
Is there an audio source in music or is there not.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.090
And if there's not then it will not run.

05:48.510 --> 05:51.600
So let's check that out.

05:51.630 --> 05:53.970
Sound behavior is going to get a new variable here.

05:53.970 --> 05:58.440
As you can see music now can drag the audio source and where they get it from.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.050
Well actually from here.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.140
So I dragged the audio source from here to there.

06:03.450 --> 06:09.660
And now let's de-activate play on awake so I'm going to deactivate that and if I run the game now it

06:09.660 --> 06:13.110
shouldn't play any sound.

06:13.110 --> 06:15.170
I hope you hear that they don't hear anything.

06:15.180 --> 06:21.380
And now let's press the space key and the music starts.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.430
So it's not great music.

06:23.430 --> 06:31.900
At least the beginning is a bit weird but then the music starts.

06:32.120 --> 06:32.730
All right.

06:32.900 --> 06:41.180
And likewise of course you can go ahead here and check if the music is currently running.

06:41.990 --> 06:52.420
So if music that is playing so well maybe you should use the square brackets here.

06:52.430 --> 07:00.180
If music is playing then don't play any music and else play music.

07:00.470 --> 07:02.880
So if music is playing don't play music.

07:02.960 --> 07:07.230
And so it means music thought stop.

07:07.310 --> 07:12.510
So stop the music and otherwise play the music.

07:12.510 --> 07:12.990
All right.

07:13.080 --> 07:17.640
Let's check that out again and pressed play.

07:17.810 --> 07:19.550
No music is running.

07:19.550 --> 07:21.450
I pressed the play button.

07:24.870 --> 07:26.600
And there's some music coming up.

07:26.640 --> 07:27.390
You might hear it

07:34.820 --> 07:35.120
right.

07:35.130 --> 07:41.290
And I press the space key again and the music stops.

07:41.390 --> 07:48.680
I press it again as you can see the music starts from the start I press it again and it's gone.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.300
So that's how easy it is.

07:52.520 --> 07:59.830
You can of course check out what other methods the music or the audio source class has.

07:59.840 --> 08:08.600
So here audio source for example if you mute you could mute the music and not stop it so it would still

08:08.600 --> 08:08.900
run.

08:08.900 --> 08:11.750
But that wasn't wouldn't be any sound coming out.

08:11.900 --> 08:16.390
Then you can of course pause it can change the pitch.

08:16.460 --> 08:18.650
As you can see there are methods and proper DCU.

08:18.860 --> 08:20.120
So you could change the pitch.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.720
You can change the property mute.

08:22.730 --> 08:28.480
You can run the method pause which will pause the music and so forth.

08:28.550 --> 08:31.510
So there's are plenty of methods you can check them out.

08:31.870 --> 08:34.100
And yeah that's pretty much it.

08:34.100 --> 08:37.720
So he paused and unpause maybe that would be the better option.

08:37.720 --> 08:41.610
So if the music is playing for the first time you could run play.

08:41.690 --> 08:47.320
Otherwise we could run pause to stop it and then unpause to run it again.

08:47.330 --> 08:49.820
All right so let's add here.

08:50.170 --> 08:51.970
Stop and we're good to go.
