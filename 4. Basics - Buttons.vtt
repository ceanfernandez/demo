00:04.000 --> 00:09.940
Well come back in this video we are going to have a look at buttons and buttons are very important because

00:09.940 --> 00:13.690
they allow us for example to move from one scene to another.

00:13.720 --> 00:17.100
They allow us to choose at which level we want to be.

00:17.100 --> 00:22.850
They are important to change settings for example or with your settings menu in general to play around.

00:22.960 --> 00:30.310
So buttons are used very commonly So it's important to understand how they work and in order to add

00:30.310 --> 00:31.880
a button to our you.

00:31.930 --> 00:34.780
We need to create a button within our canvas.

00:34.780 --> 00:40.380
All right click onto canvas then go to UI and choose button.

00:40.510 --> 00:48.220
What that will do it will add a button and that button has a child which is our text so the button itself

00:48.220 --> 00:53.260
has a text property or a text child which you can then change any time.

00:53.290 --> 00:56.190
This text is similar to the text that we have seen here.

00:56.200 --> 01:02.770
The only difference is that it has a that it currently stretches to the size of its parent.

01:02.770 --> 01:10.270
So it's anchor settings and it's anchor preset is said to stretch to wards all directions as much space

01:10.360 --> 01:11.350
as you have.

01:11.350 --> 01:15.670
Which means this text will take up all the space that the button gives it.

01:15.670 --> 01:21.010
All right button itself has properties as we know them for example the transform.

01:21.010 --> 01:25.450
We have worked with that than does it with a height and so forth.

01:25.450 --> 01:32.240
It has an image script which has a property or variable called source image which you can change any

01:32.250 --> 01:32.560
time.

01:32.560 --> 01:39.430
So if you want to change the appearance of your button you could drag an image into that source image

01:39.580 --> 01:40.870
property.

01:41.110 --> 01:45.610
All right so now let's get to how we can make this button act interactive with.

01:45.610 --> 01:50.830
Because currently if we activate the game or start a game and we press on the button as you can see

01:51.460 --> 01:56.680
it indicates that something is pressed or that we press it but nothing happens.

01:56.680 --> 02:02.230
And in order to make something happen we need to have a script which has a functionality that we want

02:02.230 --> 02:04.830
to call and there are multiple different options.

02:04.840 --> 02:12.140
You could add a new empty object where you assign that script to and then you can assign to the script

02:12.150 --> 02:13.630
to the button click event.

02:13.660 --> 02:16.560
Or you could do the same thing with the button itself.

02:16.570 --> 02:20.590
So we can add a component here which is a new script.

02:20.650 --> 02:29.130
And I'm going to call that pattern behavior and what that script should do is.

02:29.130 --> 02:32.190
For now it should increase the score by one.

02:32.410 --> 02:34.550
So let's go into bad behavior.

02:34.960 --> 02:40.710
So what we can do is for example we can try to access the text behavior script from our button behavior

02:40.720 --> 02:47.650
script and then we could for example increase the text number and then set the text number in order

02:47.650 --> 02:49.640
to change the value.

02:49.810 --> 02:52.800
We can do that within button behavior itself as well.

02:52.810 --> 02:58.010
We could get access to the text UI element in here and then access it from here.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.240
Let's use this approach.

02:59.260 --> 03:07.370
So let's create a public text and in order to use text of course we need to have unity engine UI.

03:07.630 --> 03:10.120
So the namespace unity engine UI.

03:10.120 --> 03:14.640
Now we can use the text class let's call it score text.

03:15.670 --> 03:20.120
And every time that we press the button we want to increase the score text by one.

03:20.290 --> 03:27.220
So let's get rid of the start and update method and create our own method which I'm going to call public

03:27.430 --> 03:32.910
Voyt on button pressed.

03:33.280 --> 03:43.930
So let's say when I press the button I want to change the score text that text too high or button was

03:44.020 --> 03:46.830
pressed.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.830
Right.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.580
So let's try that.

03:51.340 --> 03:56.920
Let's add that to that script to our button or it is already saved.

03:57.190 --> 04:01.720
But now we need to wait a little bit until text will be shown.

04:01.720 --> 04:08.710
So the text property here as you can see cortexes there and I'm going to use the text as a score text

04:09.190 --> 04:14.320
which is this text here it's important that you use the text on top of button and not within button.

04:14.320 --> 04:20.710
All right so now I need to add an on click event so you can see there is an on click list list is empty

04:20.710 --> 04:21.380
currently.

04:21.550 --> 04:29.170
And we can press the plus button and then we need to give it an object which contains the script that

04:29.170 --> 04:34.920
has the method that should be triggered whenever we click on that part.

04:34.930 --> 04:41.430
All right so click on button or choose button here because button contains the button behavior script.

04:41.650 --> 04:47.410
If you would have the script in a different game object then you would have to choose that different

04:47.410 --> 04:53.020
game object as the one the selected object that you select here.

04:53.020 --> 04:59.530
OK so I select button and now I get this button behavior added to my options.

04:59.530 --> 05:01.480
Before that it wasn't available.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.510
And now I can choose button pressed.

05:04.540 --> 05:08.220
So let's do that one button press was chosen.

05:08.230 --> 05:12.640
Now let's go ahead and run the game and see if our button does what it should.

05:12.640 --> 05:17.320
So let's press the button and we see t d o n was pressed.

05:17.350 --> 05:20.370
So our text is changed to button was pressed.

05:20.440 --> 05:28.210
If I press as you see as it was pressed if I press if I press the space key it says button was pressed

05:28.210 --> 05:29.400
as well.

05:29.410 --> 05:33.840
All right so let's press the button and as you can see it changes the text value.

05:33.940 --> 05:37.700
So that's how simple you can use button functionality.

05:37.690 --> 05:38.980
And yeah that's it.

05:38.980 --> 05:44.350
So now you know how to use buttons in the next we will have a look at how we can use buttons in order

05:44.350 --> 05:46.960
to get from one scene to another.

05:47.020 --> 05:48.110
So see you there.
