00:04.150 --> 00:08.480
We'll come back and this year we are going to have a look at you.

00:08.590 --> 00:12.580
Elements and in particular we're going to have a look at text.

00:12.940 --> 00:17.750
So I've created a new project called Pong basics.

00:18.080 --> 00:21.910
And in here I want to create a UI element.

00:21.910 --> 00:27.640
So in the hierarchy of you I make a I do right click and then I go to UI.

00:27.860 --> 00:29.430
I have multiple options here.

00:29.440 --> 00:33.250
I have text image raw image button and so forth.

00:33.250 --> 00:39.100
For now I'm just going to use text and as you can see the new text appears on our screen here at the

00:39.100 --> 00:40.410
bottom left.

00:40.450 --> 00:46.890
So if we zoom out to the right position we will see this is where our text currently is.

00:46.890 --> 00:48.070
It's at the bottom left.

00:48.070 --> 00:53.860
So this is the render mode that we have for our canvas which is greenspace overlay.

00:53.890 --> 01:01.700
So what that does it will overlay whatever we assign to the UI layer or to the UI space here.

01:01.990 --> 01:06.090
On top of our game mode or game view itself.

01:06.330 --> 01:14.110
So now no matter what we have in there as a game object so lets say we add a 3D cube and position it

01:14.320 --> 01:16.140
had a 0 0 0.

01:16.150 --> 01:17.170
This is where it is.

01:17.320 --> 01:20.950
And as you can see it somewhere around here.

01:20.950 --> 01:29.440
So the game mode itself is very tiny in comparison to this huge screen that is heartens to each layer

01:29.440 --> 01:33.570
which is where you I layer are canvas which is put on top of.

01:33.910 --> 01:37.150
So thats what the screen space overlay does.

01:37.150 --> 01:40.980
There are other options for X for example screen space camera.

01:41.170 --> 01:47.080
What that will do is you need to give it a camera here run that camera and it will take a different

01:47.080 --> 01:47.680
approach.

01:47.710 --> 01:55.800
So now it's based on where the camera currently is and you have a certain canvas in between the camera

01:55.870 --> 01:56.870
and to play mode.

01:56.890 --> 02:01.740
And it's it's almost like a layer on top but it's still a slightly different approach.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.430
And then you have Worldspace where you can assign a specific width and height for your canvas and you

02:09.430 --> 02:13.450
can do some additional layer changing and so forth.

02:13.450 --> 02:21.130
We will use different render modes throughout the course so no worries there we will see those in detail

02:21.130 --> 02:23.800
in the next videos or in the next chapters.

02:23.800 --> 02:28.860
I just wanted to quickly show you the different modes now within the canvas.

02:28.960 --> 02:34.080
We have the text and at the same time we also have created an event system.

02:34.180 --> 02:40.600
So whenever we create a UI and we didn't have a UI them and before our canvas and even system are created

02:40.600 --> 02:48.600
for us directly automatically and I created the text as you can see it's a child of our canvas.

02:48.670 --> 02:51.150
So it's inside of our canvas folder.

02:51.680 --> 02:56.160
And now we can go ahead and change the text for example so we had new text.

02:56.410 --> 02:59.370
Let's change that to a plain zero.

02:59.710 --> 03:02.390
And as you can see we can barely see that zero.

03:02.410 --> 03:06.230
So let's change the font size to let's say 50.

03:06.260 --> 03:09.800
Now you might say oh damn where did it go I can't see it anymore.

03:09.970 --> 03:16.720
That has to do with the fact that the height and width don't fit with the font size anymore more so

03:17.170 --> 03:24.150
our text element itself or text UI element has a height of only 30.

03:24.560 --> 03:32.480
So only if I increase it to 4 for example 60 I will be able to see my number again on my text again.

03:32.480 --> 03:38.840
Now let's go back to 13 and say I still want to keep it at 30 but I still want to see my 0.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.550
So how can I solved otherwise.

03:40.820 --> 03:43.830
What you can do is you can use overflow.

03:43.850 --> 03:49.470
So horizontal overflow and vertical overflow will do so.

03:49.480 --> 03:53.050
That as you can see your number will still appear.

03:53.270 --> 03:55.910
Now however it's cut off.

03:56.060 --> 03:58.480
So how do I move my 0.

03:58.790 --> 04:02.510
Well you can move it from here.

04:02.510 --> 04:05.930
So let's zoom out to the point where we can actually see something.

04:05.960 --> 04:13.070
So you can move it around here as you can see with our transform editor here or with our transform tool.

04:13.070 --> 04:16.390
Now you can drag it around and you can see where it is.

04:16.490 --> 04:22.450
Another way to change the position of something is of course to change directions from here directly.

04:22.550 --> 04:27.640
So you can add values here so you could say 0 0 is the right position for you.

04:27.820 --> 04:29.510
Now the 0 is not in the center.

04:29.510 --> 04:30.340
Why is that.

04:30.560 --> 04:35.010
Well that's because the alignment of our text here is not centered.

04:35.180 --> 04:41.810
So you can align it centrally in both directions and then we'll be perfectly centered and you can still

04:41.810 --> 04:44.480
change that by changing the anchor.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.580
So here for example now it's an anchor preset to the center.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.680
You could anchor it to the top left.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.560
So now it is anchored to the top left.

04:53.570 --> 04:59.270
As you see nothing has changed except for the post Y and oppose X..

04:59.360 --> 05:00.980
So those two values have not changed.

05:00.980 --> 05:08.960
So if we bring those back to 0 and 0 you can see that our zero goes back or goes perfectly to the edge

05:09.020 --> 05:11.300
of our top left corner.

05:12.480 --> 05:17.520
Now of course we would want to move it a little bit so that we still see the zero.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.580
So let's move into our game now.

05:20.640 --> 05:24.090
Black might be that might not be the right color for you if you want to change that.

05:24.090 --> 05:32.550
You can go to the color property here and change the color to for example red or white or green or whatever

05:32.550 --> 05:33.150
you like.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.500
All right.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.930
So let's take this pink because it fits into the blue we can see it very well.

05:39.970 --> 05:49.990
And then what you can do is of course change line spacing so let's say you have a second line in here.

05:54.600 --> 05:59.770
Then you can change the line spacing so let's say you want to have a bigger distance between lines.

05:59.940 --> 06:04.590
So that's the line spacing one is totally fine.

06:05.100 --> 06:08.900
And finally of course you can change the font any time.

06:08.910 --> 06:15.660
So the standard is Israel and around no further fonts by default you can download fonts either from

06:15.660 --> 06:19.680
the store or you can import them from wherever you downloaded them for example.

06:19.680 --> 06:24.810
So you download them to your machine and then you can import it from there but be careful that you don't

06:24.810 --> 06:29.650
download fonts that you don't own because some phones actually cost money.

06:29.670 --> 06:30.710
Most of the don't.

06:30.730 --> 06:36.390
So just search for free fonts or royalty free fonts and then use those.

06:36.390 --> 06:36.900
All right.

06:37.020 --> 06:39.580
So that's about the font and the text.

06:39.590 --> 06:46.660
And now let's have a look at how we can change that number programmatically in the next video.
