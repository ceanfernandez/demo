00:04.360 --> 00:10.030
Well come back and this video we are going to change the value of the text element programmatically.

00:10.070 --> 00:19.940
So let's go out and create a empty object and that's called that one game manager a game manager is

00:20.120 --> 00:27.500
an object that you can use for example to use to collect your score and to take care of states and those

00:27.500 --> 00:28.330
kind of things.

00:28.490 --> 00:34.580
And if you want to add the functionality that we can change the number here let's go ahead and create

00:34.580 --> 00:43.460
a new script and I'm going to call that text behavior.

00:45.290 --> 00:54.530
So let's open it up it's open that's crept up and whenever you want to work with text within code what

00:54.530 --> 01:02.570
you need to do or with text elements what you need to do is you need to add using unity engine thought

01:02.660 --> 01:03.610
you die.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.720
So this name space is important.

01:05.720 --> 01:10.800
Otherwise you can't create a text object.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.690
So you can see there is a class called Text basketball graphic.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.290
I lay out element.

01:16.370 --> 01:21.180
So it's an default graphic to draw font data to screen and that's what we want.

01:21.380 --> 01:31.240
So I'm going to create a public text and I'm going to call it simply my text.

01:31.400 --> 01:35.080
Now within the Start method I could go ahead and initialize that.

01:35.120 --> 01:43.200
So I could search for a text or I can simply do it like that so that I can drag it in to my component.

01:43.210 --> 01:45.920
You will see what that means in a second.

01:45.920 --> 01:58.400
Now if somebody presses on a button if input thought get key down is key code that space.

01:58.400 --> 02:05.350
So whenever we press space what I want to happen is I want to change my text and I want to change it

02:05.360 --> 02:06.080
to a number.

02:06.110 --> 02:15.570
So let's create a number and text number and let's set that to zero.

02:15.710 --> 02:22.940
And every time that I hit space I want the text number to be increased by 1 so I increase increment

02:23.000 --> 02:30.500
the number of text number by one every time that somebody presses on the space key and at the same time

02:30.800 --> 02:41.270
I want to change the text of my text so my text that text is equal to text number to that text number

02:42.210 --> 02:45.460
got to string.

02:46.610 --> 02:53.560
So what that will do is it will change that the text itself to the value that our text number has.

02:53.600 --> 03:03.530
And of course we need to cast it into a string because text expects a string see string text so the

03:03.530 --> 03:06.430
string value this text will the text will display.

03:06.620 --> 03:15.370
So my text which is our text you element will now display whatever number we have there.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.520
So let's have a look what that means.

03:17.780 --> 03:24.830
If we go back to unity our text behavior that our game manager has now will get my text which is our

03:24.830 --> 03:27.030
text from the canvas that I have here.

03:27.060 --> 03:29.620
So I have to drag it in there.

03:29.620 --> 03:37.780
Now we have a text in here and what we can do is run the Cote and see what happens if I press space.

03:37.990 --> 03:39.160
So I'm pressing SPACE.

03:39.190 --> 03:45.750
And as you can see the number goes up every time I press space and it is displayed here.

03:47.420 --> 03:57.750
You could even go ahead and say if how ever the input that was pressed is not so.

03:57.950 --> 03:59.150
Else if

04:02.560 --> 04:08.340
so if the input is not the space but let's say you Aspel key was pressed.

04:08.360 --> 04:19.380
So get the key down key code thought as that's the case then change my text.

04:20.480 --> 04:26.630
Thought text 2 as was pressed

04:29.360 --> 04:30.770
my will to see what happens.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.610
Let's go back to our game.

04:32.630 --> 04:33.470
Let's start at

04:36.520 --> 04:37.880
now concedes the zero.

04:37.890 --> 04:43.090
I press space and I press as you can see as was pressed.

04:43.200 --> 04:50.550
Now of course it's not perfectly positioned so our text you I lament was not perfectly positioned to

04:51.300 --> 04:59.640
maintain this amount of information so this amount of characters we could however of course change that.

04:59.670 --> 05:07.140
So we could change the width of it or we could move it over and we could even change to with two let's

05:07.140 --> 05:11.450
say 300 and with a little bit further even.

05:11.460 --> 05:14.030
So now let's see what happens now.

05:14.670 --> 05:16.260
But wait let's save our scene.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.400
That's always good.

05:17.430 --> 05:20.660
So let's call that one main control.

05:20.670 --> 05:22.760
And now let's run it.

05:23.790 --> 05:28.680
Now we press enter enter enter and a press press as and you see as I was pressed.

05:28.680 --> 05:33.750
All right so now you know how you can manipulate your text elements how you can use them in general

05:33.780 --> 05:39.630
because what we will do is of course we will use them in the pong game and in general in every game

05:39.660 --> 05:43.490
book because we will need a UI and that's for example how you can use text.
